### Package Installation
We can install all neccessary packages according to 'pip' or 'conda' with short time. 
All data can be downloaded from Materials Project (https://materialsproject.org/),  Materials Cloud(https://www.materialscloud.org/home), Computational 2D Materials Database ( https://cmr.fysik.dtu.dk/c2db/c2db.html#c2db) . 


## About the Code
- The training and testing process are defined in ` ./Model/CCSN_model/train.py`.
- Training results will be automatically saved in `./Model/CCSN_model/` file.
- We provide pretrain model for bandgap task in `./Pretrain_model/` file , which can be used to perform transfer learning.
